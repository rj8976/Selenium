	 * 		Priority---->TO set priority of @Test annotaion we can use "priority"
	 * 				@Test which has low priority will execute first
	 * 				For execution of @Test, testNg considers alphabetic Order

 *  	TestSuite---->collection of multiple test cases.With the help of testNg XML Suite.
 *  				We can executed multiple test cases at the same time.This is called as
 *  				Parallel Execution.It saves test execution time.
